## Codex PR Workflow

- Codex always works on a dedicated feature branch instead of committing directly to `main`.
- Every change is submitted via a Pull Request targeting `main`, then reviewed before merge.
- Follow `CODEX_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` for the canonical Codex workflow (branching, verification, PR checklist).
- Reference that template whenever drafting AI-driven updates so contributors stay aligned with the required process.
